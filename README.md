# Image Recognition Library
## Goal of this repository
I made this repository mainly to archive ML models for image recognition, but i also wanted to create a library of some ML models for others to perhaps learn and use to train on other datasets.
## Content of this repository
***- LeNet***

***- AlexNet***

***- VGG16/19***

***- GoogLeNet***

***- ResNet (18, 34, 50, 101)***

***- Xception***

***- EfficientNet(TODO)***

***- EfficientNetV2(TODO)***

## Datasets

***- TinyImageNet***

***- CIFAR-10***

***- CIFAR-100***

***- EMNIST***

## Results
