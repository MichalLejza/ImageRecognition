# Image Recognition Library
## Goal of this repository
I made this repository mainly to archive ML models for image recognition, but i also wanted to create a library of some ML models for others to perhaps learn and use to train on other datasets.

# Models

## LeNet
Original paper: http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf

Convolutional neural network (CNN) developed by Yann LeCun in the 1990s, designed for handwritten digit recognition. It consists of two convolutional layers for feature extraction, each followed by average pooling for downsampling, and two fully connected layers for classification.

Architecture: Input (32x32) → Conv1 (6x5x5) → Pool1 → Conv2 (16x5x5) → Pool2 → FC1 (120) → FC2 (84)
